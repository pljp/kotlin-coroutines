## ユースケース

コルーチンは_中断可能な計算_のインスタンスとして考えることができます。ある時点で中断し、後で別のスレッドで実行を再開することができます。
コルーチンはお互いを呼び出す（そしてデータを前後に渡す）ことで、協力的なマルチタスキングのための機構を形成することができます。

### 非同期計算

コルーチンの動機付けの最初のクラスは、非同期計算です（C#やその他の言語ではasync/awaitで処理されます）。
そのような計算がコールバックでどのように行われるかを見てみましょう。 インスピレーションとして、非同期I/O（以下のAPIは簡略化されています）を取ります:

```kotlin
// 非同期に `buf`を読み込み、完了したらラムダを実行
inChannel.read(buf) {
    // このラムダは読み込みが完了したときに実行される
    bytesRead ->
    ...
    ...
    process(buf, bytesRead)

    // `buf`から非同期的に書き込み、完了したらラムダを実行
    outChannel.write(buf) {
        // このラムダは、書き込みが完了したときに実行される
        ...
        ...
        outFile.close()
    }
}
```

ここではコールバック内にコールバックがあり、多くの定型文から私たちを救っていることに注意してください（コールバックに `buf`パラメータを明示的に渡す必要はありません）。
インデントレベルは毎回増加しています。1つ以上のネストレベルで発生する可能性のある問題を簡単に予測することができます（JavaScriptでこれでどれくらいの人が苦しんでいるかを知るために「コールバック地獄」についてググってください）。

これと同じ計算はコルーチンとして直接的に表現できます（I/O APIをコルーチンの要件に適合させたライブラリがあれば）:

```kotlin
launch(CommonPool) {
    // 非同期で読み込んでいる間サスペンドする
    val bytesRead = inChannel.aRead(buf)
    // 読み込みが完了したときだけこの行に行く
    ...
    ...
    process(buf, bytesRead)
    // 非同期で書き込んでいる間サスペンドする
    outChannel.aWrite(buf)
    // 書き込みが完了したときだけこの行に行く
    ...
    ...
    outFile.close()
}
```

ここでの `aRead()`と `aWrite()`は特別な_サスペンド関数_です。実行を_サスペンド_し、呼び出しが完了すると_リジューム_します。
`aRead()`の後のすべてのコードがラムダでラップされ、コールバックとして `aRead()`に渡され、 `aWrite()`に対して同じことが行われたと想像するだけで、 私たちはこのコードが上記と同じで、より読み易いことが分かります。

これはコルーチンを非常に一般的な方法でサポートするという私たちの明白な目標です。この例では、 `launch {}`、 `.aRead（）`、 `.aWrite（）`は単にコルーチンを扱う**ライブラリ関数です**:
`aRead`/`aWrite`は暗黙的に_継続_(単なる一般的なコールバック)を受け取る特殊な_サスペンド関数_ですが、`launch`(_コルーチンのビルダー_)はコルーチンをコンテキストの中で(この例では `CommonPool`コンテキストが使用されています)でビルドして起動します。

> `launch {}`のライブラリコードは[コルーチンビルダー](#coroutine-builder)セクションに、 `.aRead()`のライブラリコードは[コールバックのラッピング](#wrapping-callbacks)セクションに示されています。

明示的に渡されたコールバックでは、ループの途中で非同期呼び出しを行うことは難しいかもしれませんが、コルーチンでは完全に普通のことです:

```kotlin
launch(CommonPool) {
    while (true) {
        // 読み込んでいる間サスペンドする
        val bytesRead = inFile.aRead(buf)
        // 読み込みが終わったら続ける
        if (bytesRead == -1) break
        ...
        process(buf, bytesRead)
        // 書き込んでいる間サスペンドする
        outFile.aWrite(buf)
        // 書き込みが終わったら続ける
        ...
    }
}
```

コルーチンで例外を処理することはもう少し便利だと想像できるでしょう。

### Futures

非同期計算を表現する別のスタイルがあります: through futures（そして近い関係のpromise）。
画像にオーバーレイを適用するために、ここでは架空のAPIを使用します。

```kotlin
val future = runAfterBoth(
    asyncLoadImage("...original..."), // Futureを作る
    asyncLoadImage("...overlay...")   // Futureを作る
) {
    original, overlay ->
    ...
    applyOverlay(original, overlay)
}
```

コルーチンでは、これは次のように書き直すことができます。

```kotlin
val future = future {
    val original = asyncLoadImage("...original...") // Futureを作る
    val overlay = asyncLoadImage("...overlay...")   // Futureを作る
    ...
    // 画像の読み込みを待つ間中断し、両方が読み込まれたときに
    // `applyOverlay(...)`を実行する
    applyOverlay(original.await(), overlay.await())
}
```

> `future{}`のライブラリコードは[futureの作成](#building-futures)セクションに、 `.await()`のライブラリコードは[サスペンド関数](#suspending-functions)に示されています。

繰り返しますが、字下げが少なく自然な構成ロジック(ここでは示しませんが例外処理も)で、futureをサポートするための特別なキーワード(C#, JSなどの言語での`async`や`await`のような)もありません。
`future{}`や`.await()`はただのライブラリ関数です。

### ジェネレーター

コルーチンの別の典型的な使用例は、遅延計算シーケンス(C#、Python、その他多くの言語で`yield`によって処理される)です。
このようなシーケンスは、一見するとシーケンシャルなコードで生成できますが、実行時には要求された要素のみが計算されます。

```kotlin
// 推定される型はSequence<Int>
val fibonacci = buildSequence {
    yield(1) // 最初のフィボナッチ数
    var cur = 1
    var next = 1
    while (true) {
        yield(next) // 次のフィボナッチ数
        val tmp = cur + next
        cur = next
        next = tmp
    }
}
```

このコードは、潜在的に無限にある[フィボナッチ数](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)の遅延`シーケンス`を作成します([Haskelの無限リスト](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/infinite-list-tricks-in-haskell/)のような)。
たとえば、`take()`を使ってその一部を要求することができます。

```kotlin
println(fibonacci.take(10).joinToString())
```

> これは`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55`をプリントします。
  [ここ](examples/sequence/fibonacci.kt)でこのコードを試すことができます。

ジェネレータの長所は、`while`(上記の例から)、`if`、`try`/`catch`/`finally`などの任意の制御フローをサポートしているところです。

```kotlin
val seq = buildSequence {
    yield(firstItem) // 中断ポイント

    for (item in input) {
        if (!item.isValid()) break // これ以上アイテムを生成しない
        val foo = item.toFoo()
        if (!foo.isGood()) continue
        yield(foo) // 中断ポイント
    }

    try {
        yield(lastItem()) // 中断ポイント
    }
    finally {
        // 何らかの終了コード
    }
}
```

> `buildSequence{}`と `yield()`のライブラリコードは、
[制限付きサスペンド](#restricted-suspension)のセクションに示されています。

この方法では、ライブラリ関数(`buildSequence{}`と `yield()`も同様)で `yieldAll(sequence)` と表現することもできます。これは、遅延配列の結合を簡単にし、効率的な実装を可能にします。

### 非同期UI

一般的なUIアプリケーションには、すべてのUI操作が発生する単一のイベントディスパッチスレッドがあります。
他のスレッドからのUI状態の変更は通常許可されません。すべてのUIライブラリは、実行をUIスレッドに戻すためのプリミティブを提供します。たとえばSwingには [`SwingUtilities.invokeLater`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html#invokeLater-java.lang.Runnable-)、JavaFXには [`Platform.runLater`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/application/Platform.html#runLater-java.lang.Runnable-)、Androidには [`Activity.runOnUiThread`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#runOnUiThread(java.lang.Runnable))など。
ここでは、いくつかの非同期操作を行い、その結果をUIに表示する典型的なSwingアプリケーションのコードスニペットを示します。

```kotlin
makeAsyncRequest {
    // このラムダは、非同期要求が完了したときに実行される
    result, exception ->

    if (exception == null) {
        // 結果をUIに表示
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater {
            display(result)
        }
    } else {
       // 例外処理
    }
}
```

これは、[非同期計算](#asynchronous-computations)ユースケースのコールバック地獄に似ていますが、これもコルーチンによってエレガントに解決されています。

```kotlin
launch(Swing) {
    try {
        // 非同期でリクエストを作成している間中断する
        val result = makeRequest()
        // 結果をUIに表示する、ここではSwingコンテキストは常にイベントディスパッチスレッドに留まることを保証する
        display(result)
    } catch (exception: Throwable) {
        // process exception
    }
}
```

すべての例外処理は、自然な言語構造を使用して実行されます。

## Coroutines overview

This section gives an overview of the language mechanisms that enable writing coroutines and 
the standard libraries that govern their semantics.

### Experimental status of coroutines

Coroutines are experimental in Kotlin 1.1, because we expect the design to change.
Kotlin compiler produces a warning on usage of coroutine-related features. There is an opt-in switch 
`-Xcoroutines=enable` that removes the warning. 

All the APIs related to coroutines in kotlin-stdlib ship in a package named `kotlin.coroutines.experimental`.
When the final design is ready, it will be published under `kotlin.coroutines`, 
while the experimental package will stay for a while, so that the old binaries will be compatible and continue to work.

Every library that uses coroutines in its public API should do the same,  
so if you are writing a library that it here to stay and you care about the users of your future versions, 
you will also need to name your package something like `org.my.library.experimental`. 
And when the final design of coroutines comes, drop the `experimental` suffix from the main API, 
but keep the old package around for those of your users who might need it for binary compatibility.

### Terminology

* A _coroutine_ — is an _instance_ of _suspendable computation_. It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that
it takes a block of code to run and has a similar life-cycle — it is _created_ and _started_, but it is not bound
to any particular thread. It may _suspend_ its execution in one thread and _resume_ in another one. 
Moreover, like a future or promise, it may _complete_ with some result or exception.
 
* A _suspending function_ — a function that is marked with `suspend` modifier. It may _suspend_ execution of the code
  without blocking the current thread of execution by invoking other suspending functions. A suspending function 
  cannot be invoked from a regular code, but only from other suspending functions and from suspending lambdas (see below).
  For example, `.await()` and `yield()`, as shown in [use cases](#use-cases), are suspending functions that may
  be defined in a library. The standard library provides primitive suspending functions that are used to define 
  all other suspending functions.
  
* A _suspending lambda_ — a block of code that can be run in a coroutine.
  It looks exactly like an ordinary [lambda expression](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html)
  but its functional type is marked with `suspend` modifier.
  Just like a regular lambda expression is a short syntactic form for an anonymous local function,
  a suspending lambda is a short syntactic form for an anonymous suspending function. It may _suspend_ execution of
  the code without blocking the current thread of execution by invoking suspending functions.
  For example, blocks of code in curly braces following `launch`, `future`, and `buildSequence` functions,
  as shown in [use cases](#use-cases), are suspending lambdas.

> Note: Suspending lambdas may invoke suspending functions in all places of their code where a 
  [non-local](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/returns.html) `return` statement
  from this lambda is allowed. That is, suspending function calls inside inline lambdas 
  like [`apply{}` block](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html) are allowed,
  but not in the `noinline` nor in `crossinline` inner lambda expressions. 
  A _suspension_ is treated as a special kind of non-local control transfer.

* A _suspending function type_ — is a function type for suspending functions and lambdas. It is just like 
  a regular [function type](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html#function-types), 
  but with `suspend` modifier. For example, `suspend () -> Int` is a type of suspending
  function without arguments that returns `Int`. A suspending function that is declared like `suspend fun foo(): Int`
  conforms to this function type.

* A _coroutine builder_ — a function that takes some _suspending lambda_ as an argument, creates a coroutine,
  and, optionally, gives access to its result in some form. For example, `launch{}`, `future{}`,
  and `buildSequence{}` as shown in [use cases](#use-cases), are coroutine builders defined in a library.
  The standard library provides primitive coroutine builders that are used to define all other coroutine builders.

> Note: Some languages have hard-coded support for particular ways to create and start a coroutines that define
  how their execution and result are represented. For example, `generate` _keyword_ may define a coroutine that 
  returns a certain kind of iterable object, while `async` _keyword_ may define a coroutine that returns a
  certain kind of promise or task. Kotlin does not have keywords or modifiers to define and start a coroutine. 
  Coroutine builders are simply functions defined in a library. 
  In case where a coroutine definition takes the form of a method body in another language, 
  in Kotlin such method would typically be a regular method with an expression body, 
  consisting of an invocation of some library-defined coroutine builder whose last argument is a suspending lambda:
 
```kotlin
fun asyncTask() = async { ... }
```

* A _suspension point_ — is a point during coroutine execution where the execution of the coroutine _may be suspended_. 
Syntactically, a suspension point is an invocation of suspending function, but the actual
suspension happens when the suspending function invokes the standard library primitive to suspend the execution.

* A _continuation_ — is a state of the suspended coroutine at suspension point. It conceptually represents 
the rest of its execution after the suspension point. For example:

```kotlin
buildSequence {
    for (i in 1..10) yield(i * i)
    println("over")
}  
```  

Here, every time the coroutine is suspended at a call to suspending function `yield()`, 
_the rest of its execution_ is represented as a continuation, so we have 10 continuations: 
first runs the loop with `i = 2` and suspends, second runs the loop with `i = 3` and suspends, etc, 
the last one prints "over" and completes the coroutine. The coroutine that is _created_, but is not 
_started_ yet, is represented by its _initial continuation_ of type `Continuation<Unit>` that consists of
its whole execution.

As mentioned above, one of the driving requirements for coroutines is flexibility:
we want to be able to support many existing asynchronous APIs and other use cases and minimize 
the parts hard-coded into the compiler. As a result, the compiler is only responsible for support
of suspending functions, suspending lambdas, and the corresponding suspending function types. 
There are few primitives in the standard library and the rest is left to application libraries. 

### Continuation interface

Here is the definition of the standard library interface `Continuation`, which represents
a generic callback:

```kotlin
interface Continuation<in T> {
   val context: CoroutineContext
   fun resume(value: T)
   fun resumeWithException(exception: Throwable)
}
```

The context is covered in details in [coroutine context](#coroutine-context) section and represents an arbitrary
user-defined context that is associated with the coroutine. Functions `resume` and `resumeWithException` are _completion_
callbacks that are used to provide either a successful result (via `resume`) or
to report a failure (via `resumeWithException`) on coroutine completion.

### Suspending functions

An implementation of a typical _suspending function_ like `.await()` looks like this:
  
```kotlin
suspend fun <T> CompletableFuture<T>.await(): T =
    suspendCoroutine<T> { cont: Continuation<T> ->
        whenComplete { result, exception ->
            if (exception == null) // the future has been completed normally
                cont.resume(result)
            else // the future has completed with an exception
                cont.resumeWithException(exception)
        }
    }
``` 

> You can get this code [here](examples/future/await.kt).
  Note: this simple implementation suspends coroutine forever if the future never completes.
  The actual implementation in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) is slightly more
  involved, because it supports cancellation.

The `suspend` modifier indicates that this is a function that can suspend execution of a coroutine.
This particular function is defined as an 
[extension function](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html)
on `CompletableFuture<T>` type so that its usage reads naturally in the left-to-right order
that corresponds to the actual order of execution:

```kotlin
asyncOperation(...).await()
```
 
A modifier `suspend` may be used on any function: top-level function, extension function, member function, 
or operator function.

> Note, in the current release local functions, property getters/setters, and constructors 
  cannot have `suspend` modifier. These restrictions will be lifted in the future.
 
Suspending functions may invoke any regular functions, but to actually suspend execution they must
invoke some other suspending function. In particular, this `await` implementation invokes a suspending function
`suspendCoroutine` that is defined in the standard library as a top-level suspending function in the following way:

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> suspendCoroutine(block: (Continuation<T>) -> Unit): T
```

When `suspendCoroutine` is called inside a coroutine (and it can _only_ be called inside
a coroutine, because it is a suspending function) it _suspends_ the execution of coroutine, captures its
state in a _continuation_ instance and passes this continuation to the specified `block` as an argument.
To resume execution of the coroutine, the block may call either `continuation.resume()` or
`continuation.resumeWithException()` in this thread of in some other thread. 
Resuming the same continuation more than once is not allowed and produces `IllegalStateException`.

> Note: That is the key difference between coroutines in Kotlin and first-class delimited continuations in 
functional languages like Scheme or continuation monad in Haskel. The choice to support only limited resume-once 
continuations is purely pragmatic as none of the intended [uses cases](#use-cases) need first-class continuations 
and we can more efficiently implement limited version of them. However, first-class continuations can be 
implemented as a separate library by cloning the state of the coroutine that is
captured in continuation, so that its clone can be resumed again. This mechanism may be efficiently 
provided by the standard library in the future.

The value passed to `continuation.resume()` becomes the **return value** of `suspendCoroutine()`,
which, in turn, becomes the return value of `.await()` when the coroutine _resumes_ its execution.

### Coroutine builders

Suspending functions cannot be invoked from regular functions, so the standard library provides functions
to start coroutine execution from a regular non-suspending scope. Here is the implementation of a simple
`launch{}` _coroutine builder_:

```kotlin
fun launch(context: CoroutineContext, block: suspend () -> Unit) =
        block.startCoroutine(StandaloneCoroutine(context))

private class StandaloneCoroutine(override val context: CoroutineContext): Continuation<Unit> {
    override fun resume(value: Unit) {}

    override fun resumeWithException(exception: Throwable) {
        val currentThread = Thread.currentThread()
        currentThread.uncaughtExceptionHandler.uncaughtException(currentThread, exception)
    }
}
```

> You can get this code [here](examples/run/launch.kt).

This implementation defines a simple class `StandaloneCoroutine` that represents this coroutine and
implements `Continuation` interface to capture its completion.
The completion of coroutine invokes its _completion continuation_. Its `resume` or `resumeWithException`
functions are invoked when coroutine _completes_ with the result or exception correspondingly.
Because `launch` does "fire-and-forget"
coroutine, it is defined for suspending functions with `Unit` return type and actually ignores
this result in its `resume` function. If coroutine execution completes with exception,
then the uncaught exception handler of the current thread is used to report it.

> Note: this simple implementation returns `Unit` and provides no access to the state of the coroutine at all. 
  The actual implementation in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) is more
  complex, because it returns an instance of `Job` interface that represents a coroutine and can be cancelled.

The context is covered in details in [coroutine context](#coroutine-context) section.
It suffices to say here that it is a good style to include a `context` parameter in 
library-defined coroutine builders for better _composition_ with other libraries that may define useful 
context elements.

The `startCoroutine` is defined in the standard library as an extension for suspending function type. 
Its signature is:

```kotlin
fun <T> (suspend  () -> T).startCoroutine(completion: Continuation<T>)
```

The `startCoroutine` creates coroutine and starts its execution immediately, in the current thread (but see remark below),
until the first _suspension point_, then it returns.
Suspension point is an invocation of some [suspending function](#suspending-functions) in the body of the coroutine and
it is up to the code of the corresponding suspending function to define when and how the coroutine execution resumes.

> Note: continuation interceptor (from the context) that is covered [later](#continuation-interceptor), can dispatch
the execution of the coroutine, _including_ its initial continuation, into another thread.

### Coroutine context

Coroutine context is a persistent set of user-defined objects that can be attached to the coroutine. It
may include objects responsible for coroutine threading policy, logging, security and transaction aspects of the
coroutine execution, coroutine identity and name, etc. Here is the simple mental model of coroutines and their
contexts. Think of a coroutine as a light-weight thread. In this case, coroutine context is just like a collection 
of thread-local variables. The difference is that thread-local variables are mutable, while coroutine context is
immutable, which is not a serious limitation for coroutines, because they are so light-weight that it is easy to
launch a new coroutine when there is a need to change something in the context.

The standard library does not contain any concrete implementations of the context elements, 
but has interfaces and abstract classes so that all these aspects
can be defined in libraries in a _composable_ way, so that aspects from different libraries can coexist
peacefully as elements of the same context.

Conceptually, coroutine context is an indexed set of elements, where each element has a unique key.
It is a mix between a set and a map. Its elements have keys like in a map, but its keys are directly associated
with elements, more like in a set. The standard library defines the minimal interface for `CoroutineContext`:

```kotlin
interface CoroutineContext {
    operator fun <E : Element> get(key: Key<E>): E?
    fun <R> fold(initial: R, operation: (R, Element) -> R): R
    operator fun plus(context: CoroutineContext): CoroutineContext
    fun minusKey(key: Key<*>): CoroutineContext

    interface Element : CoroutineContext {
        val key: Key<*>
    }

    interface Key<E : Element>
}
```

The `CoroutineContext` itself has four core operations available on it:

* Operator `get` provides type-safe access to an element for a given key. It can be used with `[..]` notation
  as explained in [Kotlin operator overloading](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/operator-overloading.html).
* Function `fold` works likes [`Collection.fold`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/fold.html)
  extension in the standard library and provides means to iterate all elements in the context.
* Operator `plus` works like [`Set.plus`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/plus.html)
  extension in the standard library and returns a combination of two contexts with elements on the right-hand side
  of plus replacing elements with the same key on the left-hand side.
* Function `minusKey` returns a context that does not contain a specified key.

An `Element` of the coroutine context is a context itself. It is a singleton context with this element only.
This enables creation of composite contexts by taking library definitions of coroutine context elements and
joining them with `+`. For example, if one library defines `auth` element with user authorization information,
and some other library defines `CommonPool` object with some execution context information,
then you can use a `launch{}` [coroutine builder](#coroutine-builders) with the combined context using
`launch(auth + CommonPool) {...}` invocation.

> Note: [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) provides several context elements, 
  including `CommonPool` object that dispatches execution of coroutine onto a shared pool of background threads.

All library-defined context elements shall extend `AbstractCoroutineContextElement` class that is provided
by the standard library. The following style is recommended for library defined context elements.
The example below shows a hypothetical authorization context element that stores current user name:

```kotlin
class AuthUser(val name: String) : AbstractCoroutineContextElement(AuthUser) {
    companion object Key : CoroutineContext.Key<AuthUser>
}
```

The definition of context `Key` as a companion object of the corresponding element class enables fluent access
to the corresponding element of the context. Here is a hypothetical implementation of suspending function that
needs to check the name of the current user:

```kotlin
suspend fun secureAwait(): Unit = suspendCoroutine { cont ->
    val currentUser = cont.context[AuthUser]?.name
    // do something user-specific
}
```

### Continuation interceptor

Let's recap [asynchronous UI](#asynchronous-ui) use case. Asynchronous UI applications must ensure that the 
coroutine body itself is always executed in UI thread, despite the fact that various suspending functions 
resume coroutine execution in arbitrary threads. This is accomplished using a _continuation interceptor_.
First of all, we need to fully understand the lifecycle of a coroutine. Consider a snippet of code that uses 
[`launch{}`](#coroutine-builders) coroutine builder:

```kotlin
launch(CommonPool) {
    initialCode() // execution of initial code
    f1.await() // suspension point #1
    block1() // execution #1
    f2.await() // suspension point #2
    block2() // execution #2
}
```

Coroutine starts with execution of its `initialCode` until the first suspension point. At the suspension point it
_suspends_ and, after some time, as defined by the corresponding suspending function, it _resumes_ to execute 
`block1`, then it suspends again and resumes to execute `block2`, after which it _completes_.

Continuation interceptor has an option to intercept and wrap the continuation that corresponds to the
execution of `initialCode`, `block1`, and `block2` from their resumption to the subsequent suspension points.
The initial code of the coroutine is treated as a
resumption of its _initial continuation_. The standard library provides the following interface:
 
```kotlin
interface ContinuationInterceptor : CoroutineContext.Element {
    companion object Key : CoroutineContext.Key<ContinuationInterceptor>
    fun <T> interceptContinuation(continuation: Continuation<T>): Continuation<T>
}
 ```
 
The `interceptContinuation` function wraps the continuation of the coroutine. Whenever coroutine is suspended,
coroutine framework uses the following line of code to wrap the actual `continuation` for the subsequent
resumption:

```kotlin
val facade = continuation.context[ContinuationInterceptor]?.interceptContinuation(continuation) ?: continuation
```
 
Coroutine framework caches the resulting facade for each actual instance of continuation. See
[implementation details](#implementation-details) section for more details.

Let us take a look at a concrete example code for `Swing` interceptor that dispatches execution onto
Swing UI event dispatch thread. We start with a definition of a `SwingContinuation` wrapper class that
checks the current thread and makes sure that continuation resumes only in Swing event dispatch thread.
If the execution already happens in UI thread, then `Swing` just invokes an appropriate `cont.resume` right away,
otherwise it dispatches execution of the continuation onto Swing UI thread using `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.


```kotlin
private class SwingContinuation<T>(val cont: Continuation<T>) : Continuation<T> by cont {
    override fun resume(value: T) {
        if (SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()) cont.resume(value)
        else SwingUtilities.invokeLater { cont.resume(value) }
    }

    override fun resumeWithException(exception: Throwable) {
        if (SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()) cont.resumeWithException(exception)
        else SwingUtilities.invokeLater { cont.resumeWithException(exception) }
    }
}
```

Then define `Swing` object that is going to serve as the corresponding context element and implement
`ContinuationInterceptor` interface:
  
```kotlin
object Swing : AbstractCoroutineContextElement(ContinuationInterceptor), ContinuationInterceptor {
    override fun <T> interceptContinuation(continuation: Continuation<T>): Continuation<T> =
        SwingContinuation(continuation)
}
```

> You can get this code [here](examples/context/swing.kt).
  Note: the actual implementation of `Swing` object in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) 
  also supports coroutine debugging facilities that provide and display the identifier of the currently running 
  coroutine in the name of the thread that is currently running this coroutine.

Now, one can use `launch{}` [coroutine builder](#coroutine-builders) with `Swing` parameter to 
execute a coroutine that is running completely in Swing event dispatch thread:
 
 ```kotlin
launch(Swing) {
   // code in here can suspend, but will always resume in Swing EDT
}
```

### Restricted suspension

A different kind of coroutine builder and suspension function is needed to implement `buildSequence{}` and `yield()`
from [generators](#generators) use case. Here is the library code for `buildSequence{}` coroutine builder:

```kotlin
fun <T> buildSequence(block: suspend SequenceBuilder<T>.() -> Unit): Sequence<T> = Sequence {
    SequenceCoroutine<T>().apply {
        nextStep = block.createCoroutine(receiver = this, completion = this)
    }
}
```

It uses a different primitive from the standard library called `createCoroutine` that _creates_ coroutine, 
but does _not_ start it. Instead, it returns its _initial continuation_ as a reference to `Continuation<Unit>`. 
The other difference is that _suspending lambda_
`block` for this builder is an 
[_extension lambda_](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html#function-literals-with-receiver) 
with `SequenceBuilder<T>` receiver.
The `SequenceBuilder` interface provides the _scope_ for the generator block and is defined in a library as:

```kotlin
interface SequenceBuilder<in T> {
    suspend fun yield(value: T)
}
```

To avoid creation of multiple objects, `buildSequence{}` implementation defines `SequenceCoroutine<T>` class that
implements `SequenceBuilder<T>` and also implements `Continuation<Unit>`, so it can serve both as
a `receiver` parameter for `createCoroutine` and as its `completion` continuation parameter. 
The simple implementation for `SequenceCoroutine<T>` is shown below:

```kotlin
private class SequenceCoroutine<T>: AbstractIterator<T>(), SequenceBuilder<T>, Continuation<Unit> {
    lateinit var nextStep: Continuation<Unit>

    // AbstractIterator implementation
    override fun computeNext() { nextStep.resume(Unit) }

    // Completion continuation implementation
    override val context: CoroutineContext get() = EmptyCoroutineContext
    override fun resume(value: Unit) { done() }
    override fun resumeWithException(exception: Throwable) { throw exception }

    // Generator implementation
    override suspend fun yield(value: T) {
        setNext(value)
        return suspendCoroutine { cont -> nextStep = cont }
    }
}
```
 
> You can get this code [here](examples/sequence/buildSequence.kt)

The implementation of `yield` uses `suspendCoroutine` [suspending function](#suspending-functions) to suspend
the coroutine and to capture its continuation. Continuation is stored as `nextStep` to be resumed when the 
`computeNext` is invoked.
 
However, `buildSequence{}` and `yield()`, as shown above, are not ready for an arbitrary suspending function
to capture the continuation in their scope. They work _synchronously_.
They need absolute control on how continuation is captured, 
where it is stored, and when it is resumed. They form _restricted suspension scope_. 
The ability to restrict suspensions is provided by `@RestrictsSuspension` annotation that is placed
on the scope class or interface, in the above example this scope interface is `SequenceBuilder`:

```kotlin
@RestrictsSuspension
interface SequenceBuilder<in T> {
    suspend fun yield(value: T)
}
```

This annotation enforces certain restrictions on suspending functions that can be used in the
scope of `SequenceBuilder{}` or similar synchronous coroutine builder.
Any extension suspending lambda or function that has _restricted suspension scope_ class or interface 
(marked with `@RestrictsSuspension`) as its receiver is 
called a _restricted suspending function_.
Restricted suspending functions can only invoke member or
extension suspending functions on the same instance of their restricted suspension scope. 
In particular, it means that
no `SequenceBuilder` extension of lambda in its scope can invoke `suspendContinuation` or other
general suspending function. To suspend the execution of a `generate` coroutine they must ultimately invoke
`SequenceBuilder.yield`. The implementation of `yield` itself is a member function of `Generator`
implementation and it does not have any restrictions (only _extension_ suspending lambdas and functions are restricted).

It makes little sense to support arbitrary contexts for such a restricted coroutine builder as `sequenceBuilder`
so it is hardcoded to always work with `EmptyCoroutineContext`.

## More examples

This is a non-normative section that does not introduce any new language constructs or 
library functions, but shows how all the building blocks compose to cover a large variety
of use-cases.

### Wrapping callbacks

Many asynchronous APIs have callback-style interfaces. The `suspendCoroutine` suspending function 
from the standard library provides for an easy way to wrap any callback into a Kotlin suspending function. 

There is a simple pattern. Assume that you have `someLongComputation` function with callback that 
receives `Result` of this computation.

```kotlin
fun someLongComputation(params: Params, callback: (Result) -> Unit)
```

You can convert it into a suspending function with the following straightforward code:
 
```kotlin
suspend fun someLongComputation(params: Params): Result = suspendCoroutine { cont ->
    someLongComputation(params) { cont.resume(it) }
} 
```

Now the return type of this computation is explicit, but it is still asynchronous and does not block a thread.

For a more complex example let us take a look at
`aRead()` function from [asynchronous computations](#asynchronous-computations) use case. 
It can be implemented as a suspending extension function for Java NIO 
[`AsynchronousFileChannel`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousFileChannel.html)
and its 
[`CompletionHandler`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/CompletionHandler.html)
callback interface with the following code:

```kotlin
suspend fun AsynchronousFileChannel.aRead(buf: ByteBuffer): Int =
    suspendCoroutine { cont ->
        read(buf, 0L, Unit, object : CompletionHandler<Int, Unit> {
            override fun completed(bytesRead: Int, attachment: Unit) {
                cont.resume(bytesRead)
            }

            override fun failed(exception: Throwable, attachment: Unit) {
                cont.resumeWithException(exception)
            }
        })
    }
```

> You can get this code [here](examples/io/io.kt).
  Note: the actual implementation in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
  supports cancellation to abort long-running IO operations.

If you are dealing with lots of functions that all share the same type of callback, then you can define a common
wrapper function to easily convert all of them to suspending functions. For example, 
[vert.x](http://vertx.io/) uses a particular convention that all its asynchronous functions receive 
`Handler<AsyncResult<T>>` as a callback. To simply the use of arbitrary vert.x functions from coroutines
the following helper function can be defined:

```kotlin
inline suspend fun <T> vx(crossinline callback: (Handler<AsyncResult<T>>) -> Unit) = 
    suspendCoroutine<T> { cont ->
        callback(Handler { result: AsyncResult<T> ->
            if (result.succeeded()) {
                cont.resume(result.result())
            } else {
                cont.resumeWithException(result.cause())
            }
        })
    }
```

Using this helper function, an arbitrary asynchronous vert.x function `async.foo(params, handler)`
can be invoked from a coroutine with `vx { async.foo(params, it) }`.

### Building futures

The `future{}` builder from [futures](#futures) use-case can be defined for any future or promise primitive
similarly to the `launch{}` builder as explained in [coroutine builders](#coroutine-builders) section:

```kotlin
fun <T> future(context: CoroutineContext = CommonPool, block: suspend () -> T): CompletableFuture<T> =
        CompletableFutureCoroutine<T>(context).also { block.startCoroutine(completion = it) }
```

The first difference from `launch{}` is that it returns an implementation of
[`CompletableFuture`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html), 
and the other difference is that it is defined with a default `CommonPool` context, so that its default
execution behaviour is similar to the 
[`CompletableFuture.supplyAsync`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#supplyAsync-java.util.function.Supplier-)
method that runs its code in 
[`ForkJoinPool.commonPool`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html#commonPool--).
The basic implementation of `CompletableFutureCoroutine` is straightforward:

```kotlin
class CompletableFutureCoroutine<T>(override val context: CoroutineContext) : CompletableFuture<T>(), Continuation<T> {
    override fun resume(value: T) { complete(value) }
    override fun resumeWithException(exception: Throwable) { completeExceptionally(exception) }
}
```

> You can get this code [here](examples/future/future.kt).
  The actual implementation in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) is more advanced,
  because it propagates the cancellation of the resulting future to cancel the coroutine.

The completion of this coroutine invokes the corresponding `complete` methods of the future to record the
result of this coroutine.

### Non-blocking sleep

Coroutines should not use [`Thread.sleep`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#sleep-long-),
because it blocks a thread. However, it is quite straightforward to implement a suspending non-blocking `delay` function by using
Java's [`ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html)

```kotlin
private val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor {
    Thread(it, "scheduler").apply { isDaemon = true }
}

suspend fun delay(time: Long, unit: TimeUnit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS): Unit = suspendCoroutine { cont ->
    executor.schedule({ cont.resume(Unit) }, time, unit)
}
```

> You can get this code [here](examples/delay/delay.kt).
  Node: [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) also provides `delay` function.

Note, that this kind of `delay` function resumes the coroutines that are using it in its single "scheduler" thread.
The coroutines that are using [interceptor](#continuation-interceptor) like `Swing` will not stay to execute in this thread,
as their interceptor dispatches them into an appropriate thread. Coroutines without interceptor will stay to execute
in this scheduler thread. So this solution is convenient for demo purposes, but it is not the most efficient one. It
is advisable to implement sleep natively in the corresponding interceptors.

For `Swing` interceptor that native implementation of non-blocking sleep shall use
[Swing Timer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/Timer.html)
that is specifically designed for this purpose:

```kotlin
suspend fun Swing.delay(millis: Int): Unit = suspendCoroutine { cont ->
    Timer(millis) { cont.resume(Unit) }.apply {
        isRepeats = false
        start()
    }
}
```

> You can get this code [here](examples/context/swing-delay.kt).
  Node: [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) implementation of `delay` is aware of
  interceptor-specific sleep facilities and automatically uses the above approach where appropriate. 

### Cooperative single-thread multitasking

It is very convenient to write cooperative single-threaded applications, because you don't have to 
deal with concurrency and shared mutable state. JS, Python and many other languages do 
not have threads, but have cooperative multitasking primitives.

[Coroutine interceptor](#coroutine-interceptor) provides a straightforward tool to ensure that
all coroutines are confined to a single thread. The example code
[here](examples/context/threadContext.kt) defines `newSingleThreadContext()` function that
creates a single-threaded execution services and adapts it to the coroutine interceptor
requirements.

We will use it with `future{}` coroutine builder that was defined in [building futures](#building-futures) section
in the following example that works in a single thread, despite the
fact that it has two asynchronous tasks inside that are both active.

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    log("Starting MyEventThread")
    val context = newSingleThreadContext("MyEventThread")
    val f = future(context) {
        log("Hello, world!")
        val f1 = future(context) {
            log("f1 is sleeping")
            delay(1000) // sleep 1s
            log("f1 returns 1")
            1
        }
        val f2 = future(context) {
            log("f2 is sleeping")
            delay(1000) // sleep 1s
            log("f2 returns 2")
            2
        }
        log("I'll wait for both f1 and f2. It should take just a second!")
        val sum = f1.await() + f2.await()
        log("And the sum is $sum")
    }
    f.get()
    log("Terminated")
}
```

> You can get fully working example [here](examples/context/threadContext-example.kt).
  Node: [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) has ready-to-use implementation of
  `newSingleThreadContext`. 

If your whole application is based on a single-threaded execution, you can define your own helper coroutine
builders with a hardcoded context for your single-threaded execution facilities.
  
## Asynchronous sequences

The `buildSequence{}` coroutine builder that is shown in [restricted suspension](#restricted-suspension)
section is an example of a _synchronous_ coroutine. Its producer code in the coroutine is invoked
synchronously in the same thread as soon as its consumer invokes `Iterator.next()`. 
The `buildSequence{}` coroutine block is restricted and it cannot suspend its execution using 3rd-party suspending
functions like asynchronous file IO as shown in [wrapping callbacks](#wrapping-callbacks) section.

An _asynchronous_ sequence builder is allowed to arbitrarily suspend and resume its execution. It means
that its consumer shall be ready to handle the case, when the data is not produced yet. This is
a natural use-case for suspending functions. Let us define `SuspendingIterator` interface that is
similar to a regular 
[`Iterator`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-iterator/) 
interface, but its `next()` and `hasNext()` functions are suspending:
 
```kotlin
interface SuspendingIterator<out T> {
    suspend operator fun hasNext(): Boolean
    suspend operator fun next(): T
}
```

The definition of `SuspendingSequence` is similar to the standard
[`Sequence`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.sequences/-sequence/index.html)
but it returns `SuspendingIterator`:

```kotlin
interface SuspendingSequence<out T> {
    operator fun iterator(): SuspendingIterator<T>
}
```

We also define a scope interface for that is similar to a scope of a synchronous sequence builder,
but it is not restricted in its suspensions:

```kotlin
interface SuspendingSequenceBuilder<in T> {
    suspend fun yield(value: T)
}
```

The builder function `suspendingSequence{}` is similar to a synchronous `generate{}`.
Their differences lie in implementation details of `SuspendingIteratorCoroutine` and
in the fact that it makes sense to accept an optional context in this case:

```kotlin
fun <T> suspendingSequence(
        context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext,
        block: suspend SuspendingSequenceBuilder<T>.() -> Unit
): SuspendingSequence<T> = object : SuspendingSequence<T> {
    override fun iterator(): SuspendingIterator<T> = suspendingIterator(context, block)

}
```

> You can get full code [here](examples/suspendingSequence/suspendingSequence.kt).
  Note: [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) has an implementation of
  `Channel` primitive with the corresponding `produce{}` coroutine builder that provides more 
  flexible implementation of the same concept.

Let us take `newSingleThreadContext{}` context from
[cooperative single-thread multitasking](#cooperative-single-thread-multitasking) section
and non-blocking `delay` function from [non-blocking sleep](#non-blocking-sleep) section.
This way we can write an implementation of a non-blocking sequence that yields
integers from 1 to 10, sleeping 500 ms between them:
 
```kotlin
val seq = suspendingSequence(context) {
    for (i in 1..10) {
        yield(i)
        delay(500L)
    }
}
```
   
Now the consumer coroutine can consume this sequence at its own pace, while also 
suspending with other arbitrary suspending functions. Note, that 
Kotlin [for loops](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#for-loops)
work by convention, so there is no need for a special `await for` loop construct in the language.
The regular `for` loop can be used to iterate over an asynchronous sequence that we've defined
above. It is suspended whenever producer does not have a value:


```kotlin
for (value in seq) { // suspend while waiting for producer
    // do something with value here, may suspend here, too
}
```

> You can find a worked out example with some logging that illustrates the execution
  [here](examples/suspendingSequence-example.kt)

### Channels

Go-style type-safe channels can be implemented in Kotlin as a library. We can define an interface for 
send channel with suspending function `send`:

```kotlin
interface SendChannel<T> {
    suspend fun send(value: T)
    fun close()
}
```
  
and receiver channel with suspending function `receive` and an `operator iterator` in a similar style 
to [asynchronous sequences](#asynchronous-sequences):

```kotlin
interface ReceiveChannel<T> {
    suspend fun receive(): T
    suspend operator fun iterator(): ReceiveIterator<T>
}
```

The `Channel<T>` class implements both interfaces.
The `send` suspends when the channel buffer is full, while `receive` suspends when the buffer is empty.
It allows us to copy Go-style code into Kotlin almost verbatim.
The `fibonacci` function that sends `n` fibonacci numbers in to a channel from
[the 4th concurrency example of a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/4)  would look 
like this in Kotlin:

```kotlin
suspend fun fibonacci(n: Int, c: SendChannel<Int>) {
    var x = 0
    var y = 1
    for (i in 0..n - 1) {
        c.send(x)
        val next = x + y
        x = y
        y = next
    }
    c.close()
}

```

We can also define Go-style `go {...}` block to start the new coroutine in some kind of
multi-threaded pool that dispatches an arbitrary number of light-weight coroutines onto a fixed number of 
actual heavy-weight threads.
The example implementation [here](examples/channel/go.kt) is trivially written on top of
Java's common [`ForkJoinPool`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html).

Using this `go` coroutine builder, the main function from the corresponding Go code would look like this,
where `mainBlocking` is shortcut helper function for `runBlocking` with the same pool as `go{}` uses:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = mainBlocking {
    val c = Channel<Int>(2)
    go { fibonacci(10, c) }
    for (i in c) {
        println(i)
    }
}
```

> You can checkout working code [here](examples/channel/channel-example-4.kt)

You can freely play with the buffer size of the channel. 
For simplicity, only buffered channels are implemented in the example (with a minimal buffer size of 1), 
because unbuffered channels are conceptually similar to [asynchronous sequences](#asynchronous-sequences)
that were covered before.

Go-style `select` control block that suspends until one of the actions becomes available on 
one of the channels can be implemented as a Kotlin DSL, so that 
[the 5th concurrency example of a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/5)  would look 
like this in Kotlin:
 
```kotlin
suspend fun fibonacci(c: SendChannel<Int>, quit: ReceiveChannel<Int>) {
    var x = 0
    var y = 1
    whileSelect {
        c.onSend(x) {
            val next = x + y
            x = y
            y = next
            true // continue while loop
        }
        quit.onReceive {
            println("quit")
            false // break while loop
        }
    }
}
```

> You can checkout working code [here](examples/channel/channel-example-5.kt)
  
Example has an implementation of both `select {...}`, that returns the result of one of its cases like a Kotlin 
[`when` expression](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#when-expression), 
and a convenience `whileSelect { ... }` that is the same as `while(select<Boolean> { ... })` with fewer braces.
  
The default selection case from [the 6th concurrency example of a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/6) 
just adds one more case into the `select {...}` DSL:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = mainBlocking {
    val tick = Time.tick(100)
    val boom = Time.after(500)
    whileSelect {
        tick.onReceive {
            println("tick.")
            true // continue loop
        }
        boom.onReceive {
            println("BOOM!")
            false // break loop
        }
        onDefault {
            println("    .")
            delay(50)
            true // continue loop
        }
    }
}
```

> You can checkout working code [here](examples/channel/channel-example-6.kt)

The `Time.tick` and `Time.after` are trivially implemented 
[here](examples/channel/time.kt) with non-blocking `delay` function.
  
Other examples can be found [here](examples/channel/) together with the links to 
the corresponding Go code in comments.

Note, that this sample implementation of channels is based on a single
lock to manage its internal wait lists. It makes it easier to understand and reason about. 
However, it never runs user code under this lock and thus it is fully concurrent. 
This lock only somewhat limits its scalability to a very large number of concurrent threads.

> The actual implementation of channels and `select` in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) 
  is based on lock-free disjoint-access-parallel data structures.

This channel implementation is independent 
of the interceptor in the coroutine context. It can be used in UI applications
under an event-thread interceptor as shown in the
corresponding [continuation interceptor](#continuation-interceptor) section, or with any other one, or without
an interceptor at all (in the later case, the execution thread is determined solely by the code
of the other suspending functions used in a coroutine).
The channel implementation just provides thread-safe non-blocking suspending functions.
  
### Mutexes

Writing scalable asynchronous applications is a discipline that one follows, making sure that ones code 
never blocks, but suspends (using suspending functions), without actually blocking a thread.
The Java concurrency primitives like 
[`ReentrantLock`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html)
are thread-blocking and they should not be used in a truly non-blocking code. To control access to shared
resources one can define `Mutex` class that suspends an execution of coroutine instead of blocking it.
The header of the corresponding class would like this:

```kotlin
class Mutex {
    suspend fun lock()
    fun unlock()
}
```

> You can get full implementation [here](examples/mutex/mutex.kt).
  The actual implementation in [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) 
  has a few additional functions.

Using this implementation of non-blocking mutex
[the 9th concurrency example of a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/9)
can be translated into Kotlin using Kotlin's
[`try-finally`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/exceptions.html)
that serves the same purpose as Go's `defer`:

```kotlin
class SafeCounter {
    private val v = mutableMapOf<String, Int>()
    private val mux = Mutex()

    suspend fun inc(key: String) {
        mux.lock()
        try { v[key] = v.getOrDefault(key, 0) + 1 }
        finally { mux.unlock() }
    }

    suspend fun get(key: String): Int? {
        mux.lock()
        return try { v[key] }
        finally { mux.unlock() }
    }
}
```

## Advanced topics

This section covers some advanced topics dealing with resource management, concurrency, 
and programming style.

### Resource management and GC

Coroutines don't use any off-heap storage and do not consume any native resources by themselves, unless the code
that is running inside a coroutine does open a file or some other resource. While files opened in a coroutine must
be closed somehow, the coroutine itself does not need to be closed. When coroutine is suspended its whole state is 
available by the reference to its continuation. If you lose the reference to suspended coroutine's continuation,
then it will be ultimately collected by garbage collector.

Coroutines that open some closeable resources deserve a special attention. Consider the following coroutine
that uses the `buildSequence{}` builder from [restricted suspension](#restricted-suspension) section to produce
a sequence of lines from a file:

```kotlin
fun sequenceOfLines(fileName: String) = buildSequence<String> {
    BufferedReader(FileReader(fileName)).use {
        while (true) {
            yield(it.readLine() ?: break)
        }
    }
}
```

This function returns a `Sequence<String>` and you can use this function to print all lines from a file 
in a natural way:
 
```kotlin
sequenceOfLines("examples/sequence/sequenceOfLines.kt")
    .forEach(::println)
```

> You can get full code [here](examples/sequence/sequenceOfLines.kt)

It works as expected as long as you iterate the sequence returned by the `sequenceOfLines` function
completely. However, if you print just a few first lines from this file like here:

```kotlin
sequenceOfLines("examples/sequence/sequenceOfLines.kt")
        .take(3)
        .forEach(::println)
```

then the coroutine resumes a few times to yield the first three lines and becomes _abandoned_.
It is Ok for the coroutine itself to be abandoned but not for the open file. The 
[`use` function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.io/use.html) 
will not have a chance to finish its execution and close the file. The file will be left open
until collected by GC, because Java files have a `finalizer` that closes the file. It is 
not a big problem for a small slide-ware or a short-running utility, but it may be a disaster for
a large backend system with multi-gigabyte heap, that can run out of open file handles 
faster than it runs out of memory to trigger GC.

This is a similar gotcha to Java's 
[`Files.lines`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#lines-java.nio.file.Path-)
method that produces a lazy stream of lines. It returns a closeable Java stream, but most stream operations do not
automatically invoke the corresponding 
`Stream.close` method and it is up to the user to remember about the need to close the corresponding stream. 
One can define closeable sequence generators 
in Kotlin, but they will suffer from a similar problem that no automatic mechanism in the language can
ensure that they are closed after use. It is explicitly out of the scope of Kotlin coroutines
to introduce a language mechanism for an automated resource management.

However, usually this problem does not affect asynchronous use-cases of coroutines. An asynchronous coroutine 
is never abandoned, but ultimately runs until its completion, so if the code inside a coroutine properly closes
its resources, then they will be ultimately closed.

### Concurrency and threads

Each individual coroutine, just like a thread, is executed sequentially. It means that the following kind 
of code is perfectly safe inside a coroutine:

```kotlin
launch(CommonPool) { // starts a coroutine
    val m = mutableMapOf<String, String>()
    val v1 = someAsyncTask1().await() // suspends on await
    m["k1"] = v1 // modify map when resumed
    val v2 = someAsyncTask2().await() // suspends on await
    m["k2"] = v2 // modify map when resumed
}
```

You can use all the regular single-threaded mutable structures inside the scope of a particular coroutine.
However, sharing mutable state _between_ coroutines is potentially dangerous. If you use a coroutine builder
that install a dispatcher to resume all coroutines JS-style in the single event-dispatch thread, 
like the `Swing` interceptor shown in [continuation interceptor](#continuation-interceptor) section,
then you can safely work with all shared
objects that are generally modified from this event-dispatch thread. 
However, if you work in multi-threaded environment or otherwise share mutable state between
coroutines running in different threads, then you have to use thread-safe (concurrent) data structures. 

Coroutines are like threads, albeit they are more lightweight. You can have millions of coroutines running on 
just a few threads. The running coroutine is always executed in some thread. However, a _suspended_ coroutine
does not consume a thread and it is not bound to a thread in any way. The suspending function that resumes this
coroutine decides which thread the coroutine is resumed on by invoking `Continuation.resume` on this thread 
and coroutine's interceptor can override this decision and dispatch the coroutine's execution onto a different thread.

## Asynchronous programming styles

There are different styles of asynchronous programming.
 
Callbacks were discussed in [asynchronous computations](#asynchronous-computations) section and are generally
the least convenient style that coroutines are designed to replace. Any callback-style API can be
wrapped into the corresponding suspending function as shown [here](#wrapping-callbacks). 

Let us recap. For example, assume that you start with a hypothetical _blocking_ `sendEmail` function 
with the following signature:

```kotlin
fun sendEmail(emailArgs: EmailArgs): EmailResult
```

It blocks execution thread for potentially long time while it operates.

To make it non-blocking you can use, for example, error-first 
[node.js callback convention](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_callbacks_concept.htm)
to represent its non-blocking version in callback-style with the following signature:

```kotlin
fun sendEmail(emailArgs: EmailArgs, callback: (Throwable?, EmailResult?) -> Unit)
```

However, coroutines enable other styles of asynchronous non-blocking programming. One of them
is async/await style that is built into many popular languages.
In Kotlin this style can be replicated by introducing `future{}` and `.await()` library functions
that were shown as a part of [futures](#futures) use-case section.
 
This style is signified by the convention to return some kind of future object from the function instead 
of taking a callback as a parameter. In this async-style the signature of `sendEmail` is going to look like this:

```kotlin
fun sendEmailAsync(emailArgs: EmailArgs): Future<EmailResult>
```

As a matter of style, it is a good practice to add `Async` suffix to such method names, because their 
parameters are no different from a blocking version and it is quite easy to make a mistake of forgetting about
asynchronous nature of their operation. The function `sendEmailAsync` starts a _concurrent_ asynchronous operation 
and potentially brings with it all the pitfalls of concurrency. However, languages that promote this style of 
programming also typically have some kind of `await` primitive to bring the execution back into the sequence as needed. 

Kotlin's _native_ programming style is based on suspending functions. In this style, the signature of 
`sendEmail` looks naturally, without any mangling to its parameters or return type but with an additional
`suspend` modifier:

```kotlin
suspend fun sendEmail(emailArgs: EmailArgs): EmailResult
```

The async and suspending styles can be easily converted into one another using the primitives that we've 
already seen. For example, `sendEmailAsync` can be implemented via suspending `sendEmail` using
[`future` coroutine builder](#building-futures):

```kotlin
fun sendEmailAsync(emailArgs: EmailArgs): Future<EmailResult> = future {
    sendEmail(emailArgs)
}
```

while suspending function `sendEmail` can be implemented via `sendEmailAsync` using
[`.await()` suspending function](#suspending-functions)

```kotlin
suspend fun sendEmail(emailArgs: EmailArgs): EmailResult = 
    sendEmailAsync(emailArgs).await()
```

So, in some sense, these two styles are equivalent and are both definitely superior to callback style in their
convenience. However, let us look deeper at a difference between `sendEmailAsync` and suspending `sendEmail`.

Let us compare how they **compose** first. Suspending functions can be composed just like normal functions:

```kotlin
suspend fun largerBusinessProcess() {
    // a lot of code here, then somewhere inside
    sendEmail(emailArgs)
    // something else goes on after that
}
```

The corresponding async-style functions compose in this way:

```kotlin
fun largerBusinessProcessAsync() = future {
   // a lot of code here, then somewhere inside
   sendEmailAsync(emailArgs).await()
   // something else goes on after that
}
```

Observe, that async-style function composition is more verbose and _error prone_. 
If you omit `.await()` invocation in async-style
example,  the code still compiles and works, but it now does email sending process 
asynchronously or even _concurrently_ with the rest of a larger business process, 
thus potentially modifying some shared state and introducing some very hard to reproduce errors.
On the contrary, suspending functions are _sequential by default_.
With suspending functions, whenever you need any concurrency, you explicitly express it in the source code with 
some kind of `future{}` or a similar coroutine builder invocation.

Compare how these styles **scale** for a big project using many libraries. Suspending functions are
a light-weight language concept in Kotlin. All suspending functions are fully usable in any unrestricted Kotlin coroutine.
Async-style functions are framework-dependent. Every promises/futures framework must define its own `async`-like 
function that returns its own kind of promise/future class and its own `await`-like function, too.

Compare their **performance**. Suspending functions provide minimal overhead per invocation. 
You can checkout [implementation details](#implementation-details) section.
Async-style functions need to keep quite heavy promise/future abstraction in addition to all of that suspending machinery. 
Some future-like object instance must be always returned from async-style function invocation and it cannot be optimized away even 
if the function is very short and simple. Async-style is not well-suited for very fine-grained decomposition.

Compare their **interoperability** with JVM/JS code. Async-style functions are more interoperable with JVM/JS code that 
uses a matching type of future-like abstraction. In Java or JS they are just functions that return a corresponding
future-like object. Suspending functions look strange from any language that does not support 
[continuation-passing-style](#continuation-passing-style) natively.
However, you can see in the examples above how easy it is to convert any suspending function into an 
async-style function for any given promise/future framework. So, you can write suspending function in Kotlin just once, 
and then adapt it for interop with any style of promise/future with one line of code using an appropriate 
`future{}` coroutine builder function.

## Implementation details

This section provides a glimpse into implementation details of coroutines. They are hidden
behind the building blocks explained in [coroutines overview](#coroutines-overview) section and
their internal classes and code generation strategies are subject to change at any time as
long as they don't break contracts of public APIs and ABIs.

### Continuation passing style

Suspending functions are implemented via Continuation-Passing-Style (CPS).
Every suspending function and suspending lambda has an additional `Continuation` 
parameter that is implicitly passed to it when it is invoked. Recall, that a declaration
of [`await` suspending function](#suspending-functions) looks like this:

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> CompletableFuture<T>.await(): T
```

However, its actual _implementation_ has the following signature after _CPS transformation_:

```kotlin
fun <T> CompletableFuture<T>.await(continuation: Continuation<T>): Any?
```

Its result type `T` has moved into a position of type argument in its additional continuation parameter.
The implementation result type of `Any?` is designed to represent the action of the suspending function.
When suspending function _suspends_ coroutine, it returns a special marker value of 
`COROUTINE_SUSPENDED`. When a suspending function does not suspend coroutine but
continues coroutine execution, it returns its result or throws an exception directly.
This way, the `Any?` return type of the `await` implementation is actually a union of
`COROUTINE_SUSPENDED` and `T` that cannot be expressed in Kotlin's type system.

The actual implementation of the suspending function is not allowed to invoke the continuation in its stack frame directly 
because that may lead to stack overflow on long-running coroutines. The `suspendCoroutine` function in
the standard library hides this complexity from an application developer by tracking invocations
of continuations and ensures conformance to the actual implementation contract of 
the suspending functions regardless of how and when the continuation is invoked.

### State machines

It is crucial to implement coroutines efficiently, i.e. create as few classes and objects as possible.
Many languages implement them through _state machines_ and Kotlin does the same. In the case of Kotlin 
this approach results in the compiler creating only one class per suspending lambda that may
have an arbitrary number of suspension points in its body.   
 
Main idea: a suspending function is compiled to a state machine, where states correspond to suspension points. 
Example: let's take a suspending block with two suspension points:
 
```kotlin
val a = a()
val y = foo(a).await() // suspension point #1
b()
val z = bar(a, y).await() // suspension point #2
c(z)
``` 

There are three states for this block of code:
 
 * initial (before any suspension point)
 * after the first suspension point
 * after the second suspension point
 
Every state is an entry point to one of the continuations of this block 
(the initial continuation continues from the very first line). 
 
The code is compiled to an anonymous class that has a method implementing the state machine, 
a field holding the current state of the state machine, and fields for local variables of 
the coroutine that are shared between states (there may also be fields for the closure of 
the coroutine, but in this case it is empty). Here's pseudo-Java code for the block above
that uses continuation passing style for invocation of suspending functions `await`:
  
``` java
class <anonymous_for_state_machine> extends CoroutineImpl<...> implements Continuation<Object> {
    // The current state of the state machine
    int label = 0
    
    // local variables of the coroutine
    A a = null
    Y y = null
    
    void resume(Object data) {
        if (label == 0) goto L0
        if (label == 1) goto L1
        if (label == 2) goto L2
        else throw IllegalStateException()
        
      L0:
        // data is expected to be `null` at this invocation
        a = a()
        label = 1
        data = foo(a).await(this) // 'this' is passed as a continuation 
        if (data == COROUTINE_SUSPENDED) return // return if await had suspended execution
      L1:
        // external code has resumed this coroutine passing the result of .await() as data 
        y = (Y) data
        b()
        label = 2
        data = bar(a, y).await(this) // 'this' is passed as a continuation
        if (data == COROUTINE_SUSPENDED) return // return if await had suspended execution
      L2:
        // external code has resumed this coroutine passing the result of .await() as data 
        Z z = (Z) data
        c(z)
        label = -1 // No more steps are allowed
        return
    }          
}    
```  

Note that there is a `goto` operator and labels because the example depicts what happens in the 
byte code, not in the source code.

Now, when the coroutine is started, we call its `resume()` — `label` is `0`, 
and we jump to `L0`, then we do some work, set the `label` to the next state — `1`, call `.await()`
and return if the execution of the coroutine was suspended. 
When we want to continue the execution, we call `resume()` again, and now it proceeds right to 
`L1`, does some work, sets the state to `2`, calls `.await()` and again returns in case of suspension.
Next time it continues from `L3` setting the state to `-1` which means 
"over, no more work to do". 

A suspension point inside a loop generates only one state, 
because loops also work through (conditional) `goto`:
 
```kotlin
var x = 0
while (x < 10) {
    x += nextNumber().await()
}
```

is generated as

``` java
class <anonymous_for_state_machine> extends CoroutineImpl<...> implements Continuation<Object> {
    // The current state of the state machine
    int label = 0
    
    // local variables of the coroutine
    int x
    
    void resume(Object data) {
        if (label == 0) goto L0
        if (label == 1) goto L1
        else throw IllegalStateException()
        
      L0:
        x = 0
      LOOP:
        if (x > 10) goto END
        label = 1
        data = nextNumber().await(this) // 'this' is passed as a continuation 
        if (data == COROUTINE_SUSPENDED) return // return if await had suspended execution
      L1:
        // external code has resumed this coroutine passing the result of .await() as data 
        x += ((Integer) data).intValue()
        label = -1
        goto LOOP
      END:
        label = -1 // No more steps are allowed
        return 
    }          
}    
```  

### Compiling suspending functions

The compiled code for suspending function depends on how and when it invokes other suspending functions.
In the simplest case, a suspending function invokes other suspending functions only at _tail positions_ 
making _tail calls_ to them. This is a typical case for suspending functions that implement low-level synchronization 
primitives or wrap callbacks, as shown in [suspending functions](#suspending-functions) and
[wrapping callbacks](#wrapping-callbacks) sections. These functions invoke some other suspending function
like `suspendCoroutine` at tail position. They are compiled just like regular non-suspending functions, with 
the only exception that the implicit continuation parameter they've got from [CPS transformation](#continuation-passing-style)
is passed to the next suspending function in tail call.

> Note: in the current implementation `Unit`-returning function must include an explicit `return` statement 
with the invocation of the other suspending function in order for it to be recognized as a tail call.

In a case when suspending invocations appear in non-tail positions, the compiler creates a 
[state machine](#state-machines) for the corresponding suspending function. An instance of the state machine
object in created when suspending function is invoked and is discarded when it completes.

> Note: in the future versions this compilation strategy may be optimized to create an instance of a state machine 
only at first suspension point.

This state machine object, in turn, serves as the _completion continuation_ for the invocation of other
suspending functions in non-tail positions. This state machine object instance is updated and reused when 
the function makes multiple invocations to other suspending functions. 
Compare this to other [asynchronous programming styles](#asynchronous-programming-styles),
where each subsequent step of asynchronous processing is typically implemented with a separate, freshly allocated,
closure object.

### Coroutine intrinsics

The actual implementation of `suspendCoroutine` suspending function in the standard library is written in Kotlin
itself and its source code is available as part of the standard library sources package. In order to provide for the
safe and problem-free use of coroutines, it wraps the actual continuation of the state machine 
into an additional object on each suspension of coroutine. This is perfectly fine for truly asynchronous use cases
like [asynchronous computations](#asynchronous-computations) and [futures](#futures), since the runtime costs of the 
corresponding asynchronous primitives far outweigh the cost of an additional allocated object. However, for
the [generators](#generators) use case this additional cost is prohibitive.

The `kotlin.coroutines.experimental.intrinsics` package in the standard library contains the function named `suspendCoroutineOrReturn`
with the following signature:

```kotlin
suspend fun <T> suspendCoroutineOrReturn(block: (Continuation<T>) -> Any?): T
```

It provides direct access to [continuation passing style](#continuation-passing-style) of suspending functions
and _unchecked_ reference to continuation. The user of 
`suspendCoroutineOrReturn` bears full responsibility of following CPS result convention, but gains slightly
better performance as a result. This convention is usually easy to follow for `buildSequence`/`yield`-like coroutines,
but attempts to write asynchronous `await`-like suspending functions on top of `suspendCoroutineOrReturn` are
**discouraged** as they are **extremely tricky** to implement correctly without the help of `suspendCoroutine`
and errors in these implementation attempts are typically [heisenbugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)
that defy attempts to find and reproduce them via tests.
 
There are also functions called `createCoroutineUnchecked` with the following signatures:

```kotlin
fun <T> (suspend () -> T).createCoroutineUnchecked(completion: Continuation<T>): Continuation<Unit>
fun <R, T> (suspend R.() -> T).createCoroutineUnchecked(receiver: R, completion: Continuation<T>): Continuation<Unit>
```

They return unchecked reference to the initial continuation (without an additional wrapper object).  
Optimization version of `buildSequence` via `createCoroutineUnchecked` is shown below:

```kotlin
fun <T> buildSequence(block: suspend SequenceBuilder<T>.() -> Unit): Sequence<T> = Sequence {
    SequenceCoroutine<T>().apply {
        nextStep = block.createCoroutineUnchecked(receiver = this, completion = this)
    }
}
```

Optimized version of `yield` via `suspendCoroutineOrReturn` is shown below.
Note, that because `yield` always suspends, 
the corresponding block always returns `COROUTINE_SUSPENDED`.

```kotlin
// Generator implementation
override suspend fun yield(value: T) {
    setNext(value)
    return suspendCoroutineOrReturn { cont ->
        nextStep = cont
        COROUTINE_SUSPENDED
    }
}
```

> You can get full code [here](examples/sequence/buildSequenceOptimized.kt)

The contents of `kotlin.coroutines.experimental.intrinsics` package are hidden from auto-completion in Kotlin 
plugin for IDEA to protect them from accidental usage. You need to manually write the corresponding 
import statement to get access to the above intrinsics.
